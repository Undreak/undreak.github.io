            <!-- Introduction -->
            <section>
                <p>
                    In June 2024, I attended the Formation Annuelle à la Neutronique (FAN) organized by 2FDN and ILL in Grenoble. The program runs over three days: an introduction to neutronics, theoretical courses on specific techniques, and hands-on practicals at the reactor facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was the only master's student there. Everyone else was either doing a PhD or already working as a permanent researcher. I followed the soft matter & biophysics track, which focused on SANS and spectroscopy techniques.

            <!-- Day 1 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Day 1: Introduction and Theory</h2>

                <p>
                    The morning started with Alain Menelle's introduction to neutronics. We covered neutron production methods (reactors and spallation sources), basic neutron properties, and why neutrons are useful for condensed matter research. The main advantage is that neutrons interact with atomic nuclei rather than electron clouds, which means they can distinguish between isotopes—particularly hydrogen and deuterium. This makes them valuable for soft matter studies where you can use isotopic substitution to highlight specific components.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the lecture, we toured the ILL facility. The scale was overwhelming. Dozens of instruments spread across multiple buildings, each designed for specific measurements—diffractometers, spectrometers, small-angle scattering instruments. The reactor itself sits at the center, sending neutrons through guides to all these different beamlines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The afternoon split into two tracks. I went to the soft matter sessions in room 158. Fabrice Cousin covered SANS theory—how you scatter neutrons at small angles to measure particle sizes and shapes. The math was straightforward enough: scattering intensity as a function of momentum transfer gives you structural information via Fourier transforms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Jean-Marc Zanotti followed with spectroscopy techniques (time-of-flight and backscattering). This was harder to follow. The room was hot—no AC in summer—and the derivations moved quickly. But the principle is clear: measure the energy change of scattered neutrons to see molecular dynamics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We had dinner together that evening. Talking to the other participants helped—PhD students and permanent researchers, but everyone there to learn something outside their usual expertise. The experience gap mattered less than I'd expected.
                </p>

            <!-- Day 2 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Day 2: SANS Practical</h2>

                <p>
                    The second day was the SANS practical on the SAM instrument. Nicolas Martin and Fabrice Cousin supervised. I brought silica nanoparticles from my thesis work—the same ones I'd used to make nano-textured surfaces at CEA Saclay. The manufacturer specified 100 nm diameter, but I'd never verified it directly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The measurement itself was straightforward. Load the sample, set the detector distance, configure the measurement time, and start the acquisition. The scattering pattern showed up on screen within minutes—circular and symmetric, characteristic of spherical monodisperse particles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We fit the data with a sphere model. Result: 106 nm ± 8 nm. The manufacturer's spec was 100 nm, so about 6% difference—well within normal variation. It validated what I'd been assuming, which was useful even if not strictly necessary for the thesis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The data analysis was rushed. I had a train to Paris that afternoon, so we only had time to cover the basics—background subtraction, model fitting, size distribution extraction. Not ideal, but it showed the full workflow from measurement to result.
                </p>

            <!-- Day 3 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Day 3: Data Analysis</h2>

                <p>
                    Thursday morning was for data analysis and modeling. We worked through the SANS data processing steps in more detail—handling background scattering, fitting different structural models, extracting size distributions. Watching other participants analyze their samples was informative. Different systems (polymer micelles, bilayers) required different approaches, which showed the flexibility of the technique.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Takeaways</h2>

                <p>
                    The training covered the complete workflow: theory, measurement, and analysis. That's useful. Most coursework separates these, so seeing them connected on a working instrument clarified how the technique actually functions in practice.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I now have a better sense of when SANS is appropriate for a problem and when it's not. The spectroscopy section was harder to absorb in the short time frame, but enough to understand what the technique measures and how to read papers that use it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Being the youngest participant mattered less than expected. Everyone was there to learn something outside their usual work. PhD students and permanent researchers were equally willing to discuss their projects and share advice. Three days isn't long, but it was enough to see how people approach problems in this field.
                </p>
