            <h2>Getting There</h2>
            <p>
                In June 2024, I attended the Formation Annuelle à la Neutronique (FAN) organized by 2FDN and ILL in Grenoble. The program is typically for PhD students and permanent researchers. I was starting my master's thesis at CEA Saclay—the only master's student accepted that year.
            </p>
            <p>
                I followed the soft matter & biophysics track, which focused on SANS and spectroscopy techniques. I brought silica nanoparticles from my thesis work, hoping to verify their size directly.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Day 1: Introduction and Theory</h2>

            <p>
                The morning covered neutron production methods (reactors and spallation sources), basic neutron properties, and why neutrons are useful for condensed matter research. The key advantage is that neutrons interact with atomic nuclei rather than electron clouds, which lets them distinguish between isotopes—particularly hydrogen and deuterium. This makes them valuable for soft matter studies where isotopic substitution can highlight specific components.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the lecture, we toured the ILL facility. The scale was striking. Dozens of instruments spread across multiple buildings, each designed for specific measurements—diffractometers, spectrometers, small-angle scattering instruments. The reactor sits at the center, sending neutrons through guides to all the different beamlines.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The afternoon split into tracks. I went to soft matter. Fabrice Cousin covered SANS theory: how scattering intensity as a function of momentum transfer gives structural information via Fourier transforms. The math was accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
                The spectroscopy session afterward was harder to follow. The room was hot—no AC in summer—and the derivations moved quickly. But the main idea came through: measure the energy change of scattered neutrons to probe molecular dynamics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dinner that evening helped. Talking to other participants—PhD students and permanent researchers, all there to learn something outside their usual expertise—made the experience gap feel smaller than I'd expected.

        <section>
            <h2>Day 2: SANS Practical</h2>

            <p>
                The second day was the SANS practical on the SAM instrument, supervised by Nicolas Martin and Fabrice Cousin.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'd brought silica nanoparticles from my thesis work—the same ones I used to make nano-textured surfaces at CEA Saclay. The manufacturer specified 100 nm diameter, but I'd never verified it with neutrons.
            </p>

            <div class="article__image">

            </div>

            <p>
                We loaded samples into quartz cells (quartz has low neutron absorption, unlike the borosilicate glass used for X-rays) and mounted them in the sample holder. The measurement itself was quick: set the detector distance, configure acquisition time, and start. Within minutes, the scattering pattern appeared on screen—confirmation that everything was configured correctly.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                We set the instrument to cycle through everyone's samples overnight. Each participant had brought something different: polymer micelles, bilayers, my nanoparticles. By morning, we'd have data for analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not all samples were ideal. One participant had forgotten to deuterate their sample, meaning poor contrast between components. Another sample turned out to be unstable under the neutron beam. We loaded them anyway—we'd see what that looked like in the data.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Day 3: Data Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                Thursday morning was data analysis. We worked through the processing steps: subtracting background, correcting for detector efficiency, normalizing by transmission, fitting structural models.
            </p>

            <p>
                Watching Fabrice analyze different samples was instructive. Some showed clean form factor oscillations. Others had multiple scattering from high concentration, requiring careful stitching between detector configurations. Each system demanded different corrections: incoherent background subtraction, dealing with multiple scattering, handling samples that misbehaved under the beam.            </p>

            <div class="article__image">
                <img src="../images/articles/fan-2024-experience/sans-data.webp" alt="SANS scattering pattern">

            <p>
                Then he fit my nanoparticle data with a sphere model.
            </p>

            <p>
                Result: <strong>106 nm ± 8 nm</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The manufacturer's spec was 100 nm. My SAXS measurements at CEA Saclay had given 106.2 ± 8.5 nm. Two independent techniques, same answer. It validated what I'd been assuming for my thesis—useful confirmation even if not strictly necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two problematic samples from Day 2 performed as expected—which is to say, poorly. The undeuterated sample showed almost no contrast; the sedimenting one gave inconsistent scattering. Nobody had planned this as a teaching moment, but it worked as one: sample preparation and stability matter before you ever start a measurement
            </p>

            <p>
                I had a train to Paris that afternoon, so we only covered the basics. Not ideal, but enough to see the complete workflow from measurement to result.

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>

            <p>
                The training connected theory, measurement, and analysis on a working instrument. That's harder to get from papers alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                I now have a clearer sense of when SANS is the right tool—particularly for systems where isotopic contrast matters—and when SAXS is sufficient. The spectroscopy was harder to absorb in the time available, but I understand what it measures and can read the literature more critically.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being the youngest participant mattered less than I'd worried. Everyone was learning something outside their usual work. Three days isn't long, but it showed me what working at a large-scale facility looks like.
            </p>

            <p>
                I want to come back eventually—with my own beamtime proposal.
