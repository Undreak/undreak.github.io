    "paragraph1": "My research focuses on soft matter physics with a specialization in <strong>polymer dynamics</strong> and <strong>scattering techniques</strong> (SAXS/SANS, DLS). I combine rigorous experimental methods with computational modeling using Python and C/C++ to investigate complex phenomena at the nanoscale.",
    "paragraph2": "Currently preparing for doctoral school entrance exams, I'm passionate about understanding the fundamental behavior of soft materials through both experiment and theory. Beyond physics, I maintain a broad intellectual curiosity spanning philosophy, history, and analytical thinking across disciplines.",
